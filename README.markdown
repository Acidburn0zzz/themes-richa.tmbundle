# TextMate 2 Theme Bundle

## My modifications to popular themes in TextMate 1.5

This is a port of the various popular themes (due credit to the original authors) I modified for my installation of TM 1.5. My modifications include various improvements like reducing contrast to increase readability, reducing the contrast of the invisible characters so that they are visible but unobtrusive, and making HTML/XML attributes a different color than the tags so that they are easier to pick out. I will probably discontinue development when and if TM 2.0 includes an easier way to modify themes.

## Installation

1. `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles`
2. `git clone git://github.com/ravasthi/Themes.tmbundle.git`
