# TextMate 2 Theme Bundle

## Don't Use This Anymore!!!

The TextMate guys have a much better solution!

1. Preferences → Bundles → Click Themes → Check Solarized
2. Put the font preferences in the preference file `~/.tm_properties`

	fontName         = "Anonymous Pro"
	fontSize         = 14

## Acknowledgements

First let's be clear that I just mashed this together from the awesomeness 
of http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized and https://github.com/deplorableword/textmate-solarized
to allow me to use the TextMate 2 Alpha while it is being built.

So in order of awesomeness:

1. Macromates. I am going to pay for another license when TextMate 2 comes out. That is how much I appreciate your work. http://macromates.com/
1. Ethan, THANKS! http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized 
1. Tom, Thanks. https://github.com/deplorableword/textmate-solarized


## What was this?

It was a Theme Bundle for the TextMate 2 Alpha. Themes go into Bundles now. Bundles live in Avion.

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
	git clone git://github.com/agileanimal/Themes.tmbundle.git
	
## What did you do to the font?

I use Anonymous Pro - http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymouspro.html

The font size resets everytime you launch TextMate 2 right now. If you don't like my choice, fork me and fix it.
